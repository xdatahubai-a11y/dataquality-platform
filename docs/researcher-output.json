    "Build a Python-first platform leveraging FastAPI + PySpark for the best Spark ecosystem alignment",

    "Use PostgreSQL for metadata/rules/history — reliable, well-supported, good JSON support",
    "React + TypeScript dashboard with Recharts for DQ visualization",
    "Azure Container Apps for deployment — simpler than AKS for this workload",
    "Redis for job queue — simpler than Service Bus, sufficient for MVP",
